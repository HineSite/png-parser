Have you ever wanted to write your own tool to open and parse PNG's? Yeah, well apparently I did… Pouring over the PNG specs, this project can open a PNG and write its pixel data to the screen. As bad memory serves, it will only handle 8-bit RGB images and I’m pretty sure I never got the decompression algorithm working.

Uploading some of my old (more interesting) projects that were made before I used GitHub. Based on the timestamps, this project was written in or around August of 2016.
